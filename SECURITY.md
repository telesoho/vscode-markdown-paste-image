## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an email to: telesoho@gmail.com. Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

I (the author, @telesoho) will review it thoroughly and get back to you.
